If I pull a plate or spoon out of the dishwasher that is dirty, I put it back again. It usually doesn't get clean the next time either, but I keep trying. There is a spoon that has been in there since 2012. I know the chunk of food on it so well I gave it a name. I am sure it will come off the next time.
