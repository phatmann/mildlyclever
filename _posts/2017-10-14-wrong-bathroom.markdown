Sometimes when I’m sitting in the bathroom stall I wonder if I went to the woman’s room by mistake. I listen to voices and look at shoes, but it’s often hard to tell. I have no choice but to make a plan about what to do when I come out and women start screaming. It’s never happened, but it’s good to know I’m ready.
