After eating dinner at a friend's house, I used to put my plates in their dishwasher. Then I noticed thay they would sneak into the kitchen afterward and rearrange what I did. So now I put my dishes in the sink so they don't get annoyed. If you see me putting dishes in your dishwasher, it means I don't like you.
