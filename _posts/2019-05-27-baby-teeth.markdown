Whenever I lost a baby tooth, my mother would put it into a little container. We saved all the containers in a small box. Years later, after several house moves, I realized that the box was gone. Now, I figure that anyone who sees what’s inside the box could never get themselves to throw it away, so it must be out there somewhere. That’s creepy. Sometimes I can’t sleep just thinking about it.
